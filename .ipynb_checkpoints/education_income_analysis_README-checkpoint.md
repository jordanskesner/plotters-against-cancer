## Q: Is there a relationship between cancer incidence and death rates AND educational level?
1. The average number of cancer cases have an extremely weak negative correlation with higher education.  For example, the 3 columns "Some College 18-24 %", "Bachelor Degree 18-24 %" and "Bachelor Degree 25 and Over %" all show a negative correlation to cancer incidence rate, though they are extremely weak correlations.

1. The average number of deaths has a moderate negative correlation (-0.448336) with "Bachelor Degree 25 and Over %" and a moderate positive correlation (0.487745) with "High School 25 and Over %".

### Conclusions:
* Populations that have a greater percentage of people over 25 with a Bachelor's degree will see lower percentage of cancer deaths.  The reverse is also moderately true. Populations that have a greater percentage of people over 25 with only a high school degree will see higher percentage of cancer deaths.
